# Recipes

This is an exercise using Node.js to build a simple command line tool that makes a request to an API, display content, and stores the data in a text file.

I used the [RecipesAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Hrishi1999/api/recipesapi2/) to return the ingredients and preparation to hundreds of dishes. 

In the project directory, you can run
>> node app.js recipe name<br />

The results will be saved in a log.txt file.

Suggestions:

node app.js lasagna<br />
node app.js carbonara<br />
node app.js noodles<br />
node app.js eclair<br />
node app.js hotdog<br />
